  caption: 'My internet research tells me that Tudor Potteries was only in business
    from 1927-1939, and most of their pieces (including this shoe) have beautiful
    Art Deco lines. I found this shoe as part of a set from a thrift store--I bet
    it was a prized part of someone''s collection.

Apparently there have always been people who collect shoes. While working on this wreath, I was one of them.
