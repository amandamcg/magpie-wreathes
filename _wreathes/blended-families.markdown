In my hunts, I kept finding nativity sets with pieces missing—Mary and Joseph with no baby, a few Wisemen with a camel, baby Jesus all alone, etc. It made me sad that something that had once been so special and treasured was now discarded. I wanted them to be happy again, so I started collecting them and reuniting the broken sets into new families. This was one of my favorite wreaths to put together.
