  caption: My friend Stacy accidentally got a giraffe from a Noah’s ark set when she
    bought her nativity set. Now he’s part of their manger every year, so I added
    one into my wreath.

  caption: This Mary and Joseph came from an antique store on Magazine Street in New
    Orleans. Their Jesus came from an antique mall in Austin. Reunited and it feels
    so good…

In my hunts, I kept finding nativity sets with pieces missing—Mary and Joseph with no baby, a few Wisemen with a camel, baby Jesus all alone, etc. It made me sad that something that had once been so special and treasured was now discarded. I wanted them to be happy again, so I started collecting them and reuniting the broken sets into new families. This was one of my favorite wreaths to put together.
