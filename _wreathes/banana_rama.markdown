    way here.

    online but later found more at the [Dan's Parents House](https://dansparentshouse.com/) booth at the [Brooklyn Flea](http://brooklynflea.com/).

When I was making [Carmen Miranda](../carmen-miranda), I thought--what if I made a wreath that was JUST bananas? Could it even be done? It took me about 2 years, but I was able to collect enough bananas to make it happen.
