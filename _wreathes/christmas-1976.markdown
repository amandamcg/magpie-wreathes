  caption: I can't look at these sequined ornaments without wondering about the people
    who spent hours making them. Like, was it 1976, and that's why someone got inspired
    to make a red, white and blue bell? Or just anytime patriotism? We'll probably
    never know...

  caption: Why yes, that IS orange velvet on that ornament. With pearls. It couldn't
    be more lovely. AMANDA--Can we crop in on the orange one a little more?

When I was a kid, we had these Ideals Christmas books, and they had the most beautiful pictures I’d ever seen—all 70s glamour, with sequins reflecting candlelight. My family didn’t have any of these sequined ornaments, but I thought they were so fancy and lovely—especially the diorama ones.
