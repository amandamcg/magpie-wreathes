## Too Much is Never Enough
Once a theme has been established, collecting is a huge part of my creative process. I gather hundreds of tchotchkes for each piece, finding items at garage sales, thrift stores, vintage shops, junk yards and toy stores. The challenge is finding the right mix of vintage, used and eclectic items, with an eclectic mix of materials and styles. Many wreaths contain items that I’ve handknitted. Collecting enough treasures for a single wreath can take me anywhere from several months to years.

Assembling the items is like putting together a puzzle—my goal is maximum items per square inch, with an overall balance of color and materials. It’s a more-is-more philosophy. Heavy things get drilled and wired, lighter things are attached with a variety of adhesives including hot glue and epoxy resins. Every wreath has at least one Easter Egg--an item that doesn’t belong—a dog on the cat wreath, a fox on the chicken wreath, oranges on the banana wreath, you get the idea.
