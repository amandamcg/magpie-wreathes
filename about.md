## About Maggie

Maggie is the greatest of all time. That's why we call her a goat. A goat that loves shiny things, especially if they are tinsel or small enough to adhere to a wreath.

## The Process

Too Much is Never Enough
Once a theme has been established, collecting is a huge part of the creative process for each piece. I gather hundreds of tchotchkes for each piece, finding items at garage sales, thrift stores, vintage shops, junk yards and toy stores. I try to find the right mix of old and older items, with an eclectic mix of materials and styles. Many wreaths contain items that I’ve handknitted. Collecting enough treasures for a single wreath can take me anywhere from several months to years.

Assembling the items is like putting together a puzzle—my goal is maximum items per square inch, with an overall balance of color and materials. It’s a more-is-more philosophy. Heavy things get drilled and wired, lighter things are attached with a variety of adhesives including hot glue and epoxy resin. Every wreath has at least one item that doesn’t belong—a dog on the cat wreath, a fox on the chicken wreath, oranges on the banana wreath—you get the idea.
