##500 CHICKENS 

This is a game and an experience. You gather the items and pay a nominal supply fee, and I'll make them into a wreath. I accept a very limited number of applications each year. Here are the rules:
• You think of a theme, which is approved by me. 
• You collect 500 items on your theme.* 
• The items may range in size from 0-5 inches. 
• Only 5 of your items may be brand new.
• One of your items must have sentimental value.
• Most of your items should be at least 5 years old.
• Try not to spend more than $5 per item.
• You must do 5 good deeds while collecting your items. 

###Helpful Hints:
Try to collect items that are a variety of sizes, colors, and materials. Vintage is almost always better. Ugly things can be interesting and lovely when they’re with a bunch of other things. Check vintage stores, swap meets, eBay, etsy, weird places. Be creative.

###Fine Print:
If more than 80 of your items are larger than 3 inches, you may collect only 150 items, but do try to get a variety of sizes. I reserve the right to use or not use any of your items, and to add other items to your collection. 

*Practically, we'll need more like 200 items, but saying 500 really conveys the magnitude of the undertaking and scares off people who are not committed wholeheartedly.

###To apply for 500 Chickens, send me an email at maggie@madebymagpie.com. Spots are very limited. Creative entries will be given priority.
